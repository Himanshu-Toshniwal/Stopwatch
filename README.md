## Project Overview

The Stopwatch is a simple web-based timer application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, stop, and reset a stopwatch with a clean and intuitive interface. This project demonstrates basic web development skills and showcases how to manage time-based functionalities using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Start Button:** Initiates the stopwatch and begins counting elapsed time.
- **Stop Button:** Pauses the stopwatch and retains the current elapsed time.
- **Reset Button:** Resets the stopwatch to zero and stops any ongoing timing.
